After almost two years, today is my last day at Wayfair, and the 23rd of September is the date of my Abmeldung, AKA the document that proves that I'm no longer a resident of Berlin and Germany. Yes, after two years of the immigrant life, I'm going back to Portugal.

I've been getting plenty of funny reactions to this news. Some people think I had an epiphany during quarantine, others assume that I miss home and that being an immigrant was too much for me. Both couldn't be further away from the truth.

I'm going back because I got a fully remote opportunity - something that has been a dream of mine ever since I started working (and that was almost 10 years ago), and that the pandemic actually made easier to transition to. I never had a remote experience before we all quarantined back in March, but I knew that it was my kind of thing. Even before the pandemic hit, whenever I was WFH, it would be the most productive day I had in weeks.

I deeply enjoy working in a comfortable environment: from being able to listen to my music without headphones, to having my pets snuggling beside me and being able to just sit in silence, just to name a few. This is something that I have never experienced during my work life, which, sadly, has mostly taken place in open space offices. To be honest, since March, I haven't missed going into an office at all.

Since I'll be remote, it doesn't really matter where I am; therefore, going back is a question of logistics; It's easier to deal with the taxes side of things in a language I understand. I'm still sad that I didn't manage to learn more German, but I got enough of the language to master the small talk that involves walking a dog (Ja, sie sind ein Mädchen! Nein, sie sind 4 Jahre, keine Baby). And, of course, I really upped my charades game.

I really love Berlin, and I'm sad to be leaving amidst this chaos of the pandemic. I haven't been able to do a lot of the things that brought me joy in this city in more than half a year - like going shopping in Kudamm, get on a train to explore the suburbs (is Potsdam considered a suburb? It was gorgeous during Fall), walking by people dressed as unicorns and that being totally business as usual.

I'm grieving that I won't be able to do those things as easily as before, as I've been grieving ever since we were hit by COVID-19, and I really want to come back on vacations after this is all over. I'm really grateful for what this experience, both from the city and from Wayfair, have provided me. I discovered that, hey! I can move across a different country by myself where I don't speak the language, and be OK. I'm pretty badass, when you consider that.

So yeah, there you have it. Now I'll be taking a two week vacation, which will mostly consist of packing stuff and dealing with paperwork. I'll bring updates after that!
