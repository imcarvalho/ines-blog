The "issue" with having worked in a really good team and company environment is that, after you've moved on, you'll be forever chasing that experience.

Everyone has horror stories, particularly in tech, which is not the most inclusive or diverse areas to work in. Specially for women, like me, who have a [41% chance of leaving tech, more than twice as likely as men](http://documents.library.nsf.gov/edocs/HD6060-.A84-2008-PDF-Athena-factor-Reversing-the-brain-drain-in-science,-engineering,-and-technology.pdf). I'll address that in a later post.

I've met so many people and colleagues who have _never_ had a positive work experience - they've always had bad managers, arrogant and backstabbing colleagues (I've heard a manager say "oh you know engineers, they're like little Sheldons" - I mentally barfed). The list goes on.

What I want to talk about today is a workplace who actually did everything right. Engineers and non engineers that work there are still happy and can completely vouch for what I'm writing here.

### Company culture

I still think this is the most important part of an interview process - actually get to know people, and not only their coding abilities. Your company has a culture - make sure that everyone you're hiring is a good fit for it. You might have a group of amazing, talented people that simply will not thrive in your organization because they don't belong there.

### Good, in depth onboarding

I've been to a couple companies where the onboarding was "here's our repo, have fun". In one instance, it took me _a month_ to get the dev environment running properly. No one was helping me and there was no documentation. Fun times.

A good onboarding is not only about having proper protocol for development setup. If you onboard people on the company / product they'll be working on, I guarantee they're going to get productive faster, because they'll understand better the requirements given.

I had a two weeks onboarding on the product. I got to know about all the features on it. We had a day exclusively dedicated to answering support questions with real customers. Only the last two days were engineering specific, to set up our environments. Then my own team made sure I got everything I needed to get started. Some might say that two weeks is excessive for onboarding; I loved every second of it, and was motivated for longer. No "you get that working by yourself" blues.

### Have mentorship in place

I learned the most when my team lead was helping us when we were struggling. Making sure that everyone is still learning is a great way to keep people motivated and enjoy their work.

### Give people space to grow

No micromanagement was happening. We were all working together and finding ways to improve our code - that's what you get when you make sure you've got a good cultural fit, you'll have a safe space for collaboration, where everybody is free to speak their minds and collectively grow.

### Encourage mobility

There are some companies implementing a work model that allows everyone on the team to participate in projects they choose to. This allows for distinct team combinations, and also working in different topics. People continue engaged and slightly out of their comfort zone, gaining new perspectives and learnings along the way. Win!

### Above everything, a kind environment

This is the most important one for me. There's a lot of jerks out there, and these are not pleasant people to work with. These are the ones giving brutal feedback in a completely unadjusted way, disguised as "radical candor" (which is a great book! But some are misinterpreting it).

Disrespectful behaviour was _not tolerated_, as opposed to not being tolerated in theory but then actually happening without consequence. In a kind workplace, people are having fun while working together, and in the end that is reflected on the quality of their work.

You might even get results from a toxic team, but trust me, your reputation is going to flounder when your turnover rate is off the charts and Glassdoor reviews on the sewers.

### And a final note

Beer Fridays, a PS4 or a pinball table are nice extras, but these are not a company culture. Not everyone likes beer, for instance. Do not center your Employer Branding on trinkets and focus on what's important instead.
