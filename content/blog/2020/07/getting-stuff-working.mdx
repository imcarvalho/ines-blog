title: Getting stuff working
tags: fluff

When I got the idea of creating a tech blog with Gatsby, I thought OK, I have a ton of stuff I can talk about, this is going to be easy!

Except that I've spent so much time geting stuff pretty and learning how Gatsby works as I go, that I had to stop myself from coding to actually write something. So here's me, stopping for a bit to write my plans for the future of this blog.

Here's my to-do list for this site, coding wise:

- Add a sidebar with tags and months - will need to figure out how to make Gatsy recognize certain URLs need to load certain pages
- Add a footer? The pages look a bit lonely
- Centralize more queries - I already added a fragment for getting the site metadata needed for the Header, but there are more queries being repeated
- Convert everything into Typescript - I'm not sure if the Gatsby configuration files can be converted, otherwise it's only the `Seo.js` that's missing
- Compact the Header as you scroll down

As for actual topics I would like to address, I have a couple in mind:

- Some code bits that I've found useful, along with explanations
- Musings on Tech culture, generally speaking
- I may complain about people not social distancing #justCOVIDThings
- And why not sharing some random stuff? I might create a category for my 35mm film photographs

Here's hoping I will not get lost in getting stuff pretty and then never posting anything ðŸŒˆ
