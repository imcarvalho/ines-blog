title: Women's day and pipeline problems in Tech
tags: ['Tech culture']

I wanted to take this opportunity to 1) ressurect this blog and 2) put something out there that has been bothering me for a couple of years now.

In 2017, I gave an interview to a women's magazine on being a female developer. There are some things that I still stand by - like that there is sexism in this industry, which is a big NO SHIT piece of information but let's move on - and others not so much. That is expected, and it came from growth and more experience.

One of the things I said was that Tech has a pipeline issue, and that is why we don't have more women in the workforce for software development - you can't find enough women to hire. We need to target young girls and women within school age to basically let them know that Tech is not something exclusive to men at all.

Technically, that is not incorrect. We still have some people passing this idea to children that they are limited by their gender to certain jobs when they grow up.

But is it only because of that?

I don't agree with it anymore.

I already knew what the industry looked like even before I joined it. I knew that a lot of the people on software development were the same people you could find on the online gaming community, for instance. Lots of men, some of them toxic.

That has been a reality for a lot of workplaces I've been at. Men who made innapropriate comments as my bosses. Men who were hostile to women, generally speaking. Men who wouldn't listen to women because "they don't know what they're talking about". "Oh you like video games? NAME ALL THE DIRECTORS OF THE TOP 10 GAMES FROM 1985!".

You might have a pipeline issue because there are no women to hire on the field. But one of the reasons there aren't as many of us as it should is because the industry is very toxic. Some young women know it and don't want to go through that, some find out in college when it's dudebro culture everywhere (at least it was for me) and give up their degree, some find their first jobs are insufferable and leave the industry, and some leave the industry after years of getting ignored in meetings, passed on for promotions, and general abuse and mistreatment in the workplace.

Surviving in this industry requires a lot and armour that you build up throughout the years, and not everyone has the energy for that.

I'm very grateful that, with all the interviewing I've done in my lifetime and all the shit I've witnessed in companies, I now have both the insight to ask the right questions during interviews to understand the general vibe of a company (pro tip: if you ask about the company culture and the interviewer doesn't understand that you're getting at "how I, as a woman, will be treated at this company?", it may be a bad sign), and the luxury to have choices. I no longer need to accept a job offer because I can't find anything else and subject myself to horrible treatment because I'm a woman.

But many women don't have that. And eventually they get fed up with the constant bullshit and injustice they're thrown every day.

So, yeah. It's not a pipeline problem. It's a culture problem, widespread in the industry. If you take care to build a workplace that is actually inclusive and not just lip service, you'll be more likely to find more women on your pipeline for hiring. And you'll be contributing for a more positive industry and giving women more choices.
